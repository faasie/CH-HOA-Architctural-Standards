1. Screening may be required along the property lines in order to block the view and/or noise from neighboring lots. Landscape plans must be provided with the submittal.
1. Non-permanent play equipment should be placed inconspicuously so that it does not detract from the neighborhood surroundings and meets setback requirements.
