# Fences

All fences require architectural approval prior to construction.

**Styles:** Stockade fences should be constructed in a Scalloped or Rainbow design, with decorative
exposed posts.

**Color:** Color may be natural, natural wood-color or white stain. Painted fences are strictly
prohibited.

**Materials:** Stockade (wood) may be either cedar, redwood, or treated pine lumber. Metal (wrought iron style) may be powder coated aluminum or wrought iron. Chain link, wire, and metal slat is not allowed. Any other material must be approved.

**Height:** The maximum height allowed is five (5) feet measured from the ground to the top of any
portion of the fence, including decorative posts.

Location:
1. The fence location shall not extend beyond midway of the front and rear of the dwelling.
1. All fences (including any live screening) must be constructed within the property line with full regard for setbacks.
1. Property owners are cautioned that building a fence that infringes on easements or access of right-of-ways may result in destruction or removal of the fence. Such construction is done entirely at the risk and expense of the property owners.
1. Existing topography and landscaping within a buffer shall not be disturbed except with the approval of the Architectural Committee. Construction within a buffer area may also require approval from Town of Wake Forest.
1. A top-down map (surveyorâ€™s plot plan) to indicate the exact location of the fence in relation to the house and property lines is required with the dimensions, elevations (side view) and gate location.
1. Setback may be required for the sake of landscaping, sidewalks, etc.
1. Corner and end lots may require additional setback and/or screening.

Landscaping must be included with the submittal.

Construction details require all hardware to be weather resistant, posts to be set in concrete, and finished side (where applicable) of fence must face the adjoining lots.

Process:
1. Each installation will be examined on its own merit. No previously approved installation shall constitute a precedent for approval.
1. No construction shall begin without written approval from the Architectural Committee.
1. Allow enough time (30 days) for processing and approval in planning for construction.
