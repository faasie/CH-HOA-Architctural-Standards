# Additions and Structural Changes to Homes

All external additions or structural changes to homes must have architectural approval before
construction begins. This includes, but is not limited to, new rooms, porches, garages, carports
or attached structures. Changes to windows, doors, or chimneys/fireplaces also require approval.

Normal maintenance to preserve the structure in its original state does not require architectural
approval.

Information required in submittal:
1. Plot plan showing the location of the structure and distance from any lot lines, as well as the location of any existing trees that may need to be removed to complete the addition.
1. Elevations showing the planned appearance of the structure.
1. Description of materials to be used including siding, paint colors and shingle samples if applicable.

Guidelines:
1. No addition shall encroach upon the setbacks for the lot as listed in Article VIII of the Covenants.
1. Additions should match the house color and style as much as possible.
1. Any building permits needed are the responsibility of the homeowner.
