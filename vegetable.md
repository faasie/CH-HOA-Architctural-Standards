# Vegetable Garden Plots

Vegetable garden plots will not require prior approval of the Architectural Committee, if they are wholly located in the rear portion of the lot and a minimum of ten (10) feet from the side and rear lot lines. Any tree removal required to provide space for the garden plot must adhere to the tree removal guidelines.

Architectural Committee approval is required for any vegetable garden plot location deviating from the guidelines.

Guidelines:
Maintenance of the garden plot is required. Excess debris will be removed at the end of the gardening season
and the plot returned to a natural state. This would include stakes and any other structural additions required for
harvesting the garden.

In addition, no compost piles are allowed on any portion of property located within the Subdivision.
