# Painting of Exterior of House or Structures

Changes to existing colors require architectural approval. Color samples must be included with the submittal.

Brick finishes are required to remain unpainted except to match any existing painted brick house color.

Exposed cement foundations (stamped or smooth) must be painted to match the house ‘body’ color.

Items not requiring architectural approval:

* Periodic re-painting and re-staining with the existing color for maintenance.
