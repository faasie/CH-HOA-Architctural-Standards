# Skylights and Attic Fans

The addition of a skylight, solar panel, or attic fan that changes the exterior of the roof requires architectural approval.

Information required in submittal:
1. Plot plan showing the location of the addition.
1. Description of style, size, and materials to be used.

Guidelines:
The addition of a skylight or attic fan must be located on the section of roof facing the back of the lot.

In accordance with North Carolina (NCGS Section 22B-20) the installation of Solar panels is prohibited if they are visible on the house’s facade or slope of roof that is facing any area “open to common or public access” (in other words, visible from the street or common areas). If not visible from the street or common areas, the Association may still regulate the location and screening of the solar panels, as long as “reasonable use” of the solar panels can be made.
