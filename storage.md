Temporary storage of lawn/deck furnishings, garden equipment, and materials for repair or remodeling projects must be discreetly placed and appropriately screened from view from any street or adjoining property.

Rubbish and recycle containers must be placed out of the direct view from the street.

Storage containers i.e. Pack Rat, Pods, etc. and other temporary box-type container storage units placed on driveways or in yards are prohibited. Exceptions may be made for temporary use (no more than 3 days) to support a move. Such exception must be submitted (telephone request is acceptable) for Architectural review.
