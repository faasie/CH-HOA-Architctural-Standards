# Appeals

The homeowner may appeal a denied submittal by submitting a written request for
reconsideration to the Board of Directors. Specific, detailed information should be included that
clarifies why the submittal should be reconsidered. The homeowner may request a meeting with
the Board of Directors to discuss the submittal. Please contact the management company to be
placed on the agenda for the next Board of Directors meeting.

The request is deemed denied and the decision of the Architectural Committee continues in effect
unless and until the Board of Directors reverses or modifies such decision.
