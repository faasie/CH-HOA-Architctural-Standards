# Architectural Submittal and Approval Process

Each homeowner has the responsibility to complete an Architectural Request Form prior to making any changes, additions, or deletions to the exterior of their home or property. The process will be the same for all submittals with the required details varying depending upon the
type of change.

Failure to submit a request **_prior to the start of work_** may result in denial and/or removal at the ownersâ€™ expense.

Items to be submitted:
1. Architectural Request Form completed in its entirety.
2. Plot plan outlining the position or placement of the change or additions.
3. Drawings / plans showing the construction of the change or addition.
4. Samples of paint, siding, or any other items that may be helpful in making a decision.
Submit your completed Architectural Request Form to the management company for initial
review. Incomplete submittals will be returned to the homeowner and are deemed denied until
completed.
Completed submittals will be forwarded to the Architectural Committee representative prior to the
next scheduled meeting for review and site visit.
A homeowner who wishes to meet with the Architectural Committee should contact the
management company to be placed on the agenda for the next scheduled meeting.
The management company will complete a standard response letter indicating the final decision.
Approval of any submittal or portion thereof does not ensure approval of similar submittals, as
each submittal will be considered on its own merits. Any alterations/deviations may require
resubmittal. Please contact the management company for more information.
