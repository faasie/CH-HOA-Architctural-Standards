# Landscaping

After initial construction, removal of a tree with trunk diameter exceeding six (6) inches at a height of four (4) feet above ground level requires architectural approval. Other types of landscaping that are structural or change the contour of the land or are adjacent to a property line, or obstruct a neighbor’s view require architectural approval.

Items not requiring architectural approval:
1. Landscaping of a minor nature such as naturalizing an area of the yard or adding low growing shrubs and bedding flowers provided they do not encroach upon neighboring properties.

Information required in submittal:
1. Plot plan showing quantity and location of plants
1. Description of plants
1. Drainage/runoff proposals, which detail any landscape plan that may change the flow of any
drainage/runoff, shall be submitted with a plot plan and the drawings showing the present
drainage/runoff with the proposed change in the drainage/runoff flow. If the proposed plan requires a
permit from the Corp of Engineers, Town of Wake Forest, or any governmental agency, a copy of the
permit must be provided with the request. This includes, but is not limited to anything that affects
lakes, streams, creeks, buffers, and wetlands.
1. Retaining walls five (5) feet or greater in height require an Engineer’s stamp of approval for structural integrity.

Guidelines:

Grasses (non-decorative)
1. Tall Fescue and Tall Fescue blends are preferred. Other grasses or materials that maintain the
aesthetic appearance of the neighborhood i.e., Bermuda, Zoysia, or other varieties, may be
considered with submittal of an Architectural Request. Any costs in support of a conditional approval
will be borne by the applicant.

Hedges and Screen Plantings
1. No hedge or screen planting shall be erected on any lot closer to the front lot line than the front of the house.
1. Replacement of dead/damaged shrubs and plantings as provided by the builder is acceptable.
1. Hedge or screen plantings, which form a barrier between properties, should have
    - agreement for maintenance access, and
    - setbacks to allow for plant growth.

Mulching and Bedding Materials
1. Only natural materials i.e. pine straw, cedar chips, bark, etc. may be used.
1. Inorganic materials i.e. stones, various forms of rock, crushed brick, etc. should not be used. Use of white rock/stones is not recommended due to the high maintenance requirements.
