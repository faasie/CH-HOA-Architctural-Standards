# Maintenance

It is the primary responsibility of each homeowner to maintain his/her property in a way that does not detract from the overall beauty of the community. It is hoped that each homeowner will take this responsibility seriously, as this can severely affect the value of all properties.

Following is a list of areas that should be reviewed on a regular basis to insure that your home is in good repair:
1. Shrubbery, Trees, and Lawns
1. Flower Beds, Landscaped/Natural Areas
1. Exterior Decorative Lighting
1. Driveways, Sidewalks and Steps
1. Decks and Patios
1. Fences
1. Play Equipment
1. Roofing
1. Wood
1. Paint and Stain
1. Garbage Can Storage
1. Mailbox and Post

Deterioration:
If at any time, the Board of Directors is made aware of a property that has deteriorated to the point that it is affecting the aesthetics of the Community; the Management Company will make a site inspection.

Based on the severity of the deterioration, the homeowner will be given a specified length of time to make the necessary repairs. If after that time, the repairs have still not been made, the Board of Directors may pursue the remedies set forth in Article XIII, Section 10 of the Declaration.

In order to ensure that the overall beauty of the community is maintained, yard waste/grass clippings, as well as trash and recycle containers, must not be placed at the curb-side before the evening prior to pick up. Bins must be taken in by the evening of the following day. Waste materials and containers/bins must be stowed neatly, out of site from street view, until the day before collection.
