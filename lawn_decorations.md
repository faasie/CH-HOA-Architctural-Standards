Guidelines:

Every effort should be made to not disturb or adversely affect neighbors particularly with the installation of flood
and security lights. The committee reserves the right to require a homeowner to remove an item if surrounding
homeowners complain and if, upon inspection, the Architectural Committee considers, in their sole discretion, the
item unsightly or a nuisance.

Rent/For Rent signs are not an effective or appropriate means of advertising in this community and, as such, are
detrimental to the overall value of our properties
