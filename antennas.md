Any satellite dish or disc that is one meter or less in diameter is permitted **without** application and approval of the Committee so long as:
1. the dish or disc is located on a part of the lot so as not to be clearly and readily visible from any street or any neighboring lots, provided that such a location does not preclude the reception of an acceptable quality signal, or is located anywhere on the lot but is reasonably and adequately screened to prevent visibility from any street or any neighboring lots
1. the lot owner registers the disc or dish in writing with the Association’s Management Firm stating the owner’s name and address, the name, type, height, diameter, and sketch of the lot and dwelling showing the existing location.

Any satellite dish or disc that is greater than one meter in diameter or any antenna that is designed to receive any signal other than television broadcast signals are **not** permitted on the Properties.

Antennas such as used for CB or HAM radio are **not** permitted.

Exterior mounted TV antennas require prior architectural approval.
